## *About me*
I am a .Net web developer with experience. At this stage, I need new knowledge as a breath of fresh air. I want to improve my knowledge of JS, HTML and CSS. Then I want to learn frameworks. I have experience working in an agile technology team using TFS. I like to learn new technologies, search for information about new components and libraries in the documentation and learn the best practices of other programmers. In the future, I plan to work in a company specializing in SOFTWARE development. It will be a different experience than working in a Department at a large enterprise like I have now
